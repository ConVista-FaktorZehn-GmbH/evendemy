# Evendemy 

## What is Evendemy...
It is a community app for your company. 
Create appointments for your trainings, meetings or for anything worth celebrating.

Note: At the moment Evendemy is in an early version available. We use it at our company and have made great events with it - but maybe we will make some breaking changes in future as long as we are in beta ;-)  

## What is inside...
Evendemy consists of two parts: the [backend](server/) and the [frontend](webapp/).
For more detailed information see the readme of the server and webapp folder.
