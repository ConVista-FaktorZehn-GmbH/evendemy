            </div>
            <p>
            Each meeting you create is visible for all members and everyone can participate! 
            With this tool you can strengthen the sense of community at your company and bring people together. 
            You can offer courses easily and therefore distribute knowledge faster and in a better way.
            </p>
            <p>
            Evendemy is built to be easy to use. Create meetings and everyone in your community will be informed with a mail about it. 
            People who are interessted can tell you that they want to participate with just one click.<br/>
            Next, you will be informed and the participant will get a notification via mail with a calendar entry. Everything is transparent. After your meeting, you can decide who really took part. 
            This is a really easy solution that can enhance your "work together". 
            </p>

            <h2>How can I use it?</h2>
